        be talking about my day.
    </p>

        Let's start with my morning, i woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in the park. It was a beautiful sunny day and the birds were singing. I saw many walking thier dogs and children playing. It was very refreshing.
